Documentation and source code for TiM-Controller, a desktop cab controller for Trains In Motion

## What is a TiM-Controller?
This is supposted to be a desktop cab controller, including buttons and a throttle lever, similar to a Raildriver, but made for Trains In Motion, a railroading centered Minecraft mod, although it can be remapped to use it for other uses as well.

## Specifications
The controllers hardware will be based off of the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4, with a carrier board. More detailed information can be found [here](https://github.com/FloofyPeachy/TiM-Controller/Hardware/SPECS.md)

The controllers software runs node.js as a backend, and if there is a display attached, a Flutter as a frontend. More detailed information can be found [here](https://github.com/FloofyPeachy/TiM-Controller/Software/SPECS.md)
## Documentation
Documentation for ideas and possible features are found in either [Hardware](https://github.com/FloofyPeachy/TiM-Controller/Hardware), or [Software](https://github.com/FloofyPeachy/TiM-Controller/Software). Check it out, if you want.
## Things to consider
This is still in the "i'm thinking about it phase", which things (especially related to hardware) may not be completely finalized yet and are just ideas. However, the software side of things is currently being worked on, and will be published here for you to look at.
